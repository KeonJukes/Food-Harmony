**Food Harmony** is a vibe code hackathon project designed to solve the common challenge of finding suitable dining options that respect complex or restrictive dietary needs. By allowing users to create a detailed **Personal Food Profile**, the application intelligently filters and displays nearby restaurants, cafes, and bakeries whose menu items (foods, drinks, and desserts) align with their exact requirements.

 The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/KluA1YwfObA7jcc3cjvrdr/Personal-Food-Profile-App.

‚ú® Features
----------

Food Harmony focuses on personalization and location-based filtering to ensure a seamless dining experience:

*   **Customizable Food Profile:** Users can configure multiple exclusion lists, including:
    
    *   Specific **Allergens** (e.g., peanuts, shellfish).
        
    *   Defined **Diets** (e.g., Keto, Vegan, Gluten-Free).
        
    *   Individual **Ingredient Exclusions** (e.g., no refined sugar, no specific spice).
        
*   **Geolocation Search:** Automatically detects the user's current location to provide highly relevant nearby results.
    
*   **Intelligent Filtering & Ranking:** Prioritizes food establishments based on the confidence that they can accommodate the user's detailed profile.
    
*   **Item-Level Compliance:** Displays specific menu items confirmed (or algorithmically matched) to be compliant with the user's Food Profile.
    
*   **Intuitive Interface:** A clean, responsive UI built with **React** for a fast and friendly user experience on both mobile and desktop.
